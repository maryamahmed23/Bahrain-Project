        <section> 
        <h2 id="one" class="bf">Breakfast</h2>
         <p id="two" class="brk">The most famous breakfast dish is balaleet. It is vermicelli with an omlette. 
         The mixture might gross some people out, however you could not find a more perfect combination to satisfy your taste buds. Moving along to the  next dish, which is tomatoes and eggs. 
         This dish is very self explanatory. To summarize, it is tomatoes mixed in with different spices scrambles with some eggs. The least breakfast dish is Mahyawa.
         This dish is like no other. If you thought balaleet did not sound appetiting, wait until you hear what mahyawa is made of. Mahyawa is basically fish oil. The 
         way to eat it is fairly simple, grad a piece of bread or khubz and just dip away. Even though it might not sound tasty, this dish is beloved by many Bahrainis and you never know until you tried it yourself.
         Finally, it is not a traditional breakfast without some milk tea. It is a necessity in the Bahraini breakfast. These are only some of the traditional Bahraini breakfast dishes.

        <div><section><p id="two" class="din">The most famous thing you can get for dinner is tikka. It can either be chicken or lamb, depending on your liking.

        <h2 id="one" >Dessert</h2>
        <div><section><p id="two" class="dess">Halwa is a very famous bahraini sweet dish that is loved by many. Even people from neighboring countries make sure to leave back with Halwa for their families. 
            It contains sugar, starch, water, rose water, oil, saffron, food coloring and some nuts for garnish on top. 
            However, it does contain alot of sugars and starch, which is a negative for some people. Another dessert that is popular in Bahrain is Aseeda. 
            It contains many ingredients similar to Halwa. It consists of flour, water, sugar, oil, some spices and some scrambled eggs on top to compliment the flour based part of the dish.
