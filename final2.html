         <h2 class="position1">Men </h2>  
             <section><p class="men"> Men clothing is mainly centered around on thing, which is the thobe. A thobe is a long garment of clothing that comes in different colors, but mainly white, brown or black. 
             The white thobe is typically worn during the summer. On the other hand, the brown and black are worn during winter time. 
             Depending on the occasion, they add to that piece of clothing. 
             For example, for weddings they tend to wear something called a <q>bsht</q> with their thobe and their <q>ghitra</q>. A <q>ghitra</q> is a head garment that men wear over their head. In addition to the "ghitra", they 
             wear a small patterned cap that goes under the "ghitra" and a "eqal" above the "ghitra" to stabilize it from falling. The only piece of clothing that is considered "fancy" and not for everyday use is the "bsht".</p></section>

        <h2 class="position2">Women</h2>
             <section><p class="women"> As for women, they wear abayas and hijab. An abaya is a long article of clothing that women wear to be modest. A hijab is a headscarf that muslim women wear over their heads to cover their hair. 
             Abayas were mainly worn in the color black. However as times changed people put their own twist on it by adding new designs and colors.
             During a special occasion like  gerga'oon, girls wear a pretty piece of clothing that is beaded with different designs. As shown in the picture down below. 
             Moving on to older women, they usually wear jalabeyas with a thobe, however it is different than a man's <q>thobe</q>. In addition to the jalabeya and thobe they wear a <q>batoola</q> or <q>burqa</q>. The "burqa" is worn mostly by older women to cover their faces, however it is not as common as the olden days.
