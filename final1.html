            <p class="BH"> Bahrain is a tiny island located in the Middle East, also known as the Kingdom of Bahrain.
             It is considered to be the smallest country in the gulf region. 
             It is mainly known for agriculture, sea and pearl diving. Additionally, it is known to have the kindest and most welcoming citizens. Bahrain's total population is around one million;
             half these people being <q>Bahraini</q> while the other half of the population is made up of other nationalities. 
             Bahrain was found on August 14, 1971. However, the Bahraini citizens celebrate their national day on the 16th of December because that is when they became independant. 
             Bahrain is a monarchy and the royal family that rules it are the AlKhalifa. The current king of the Kingdom is Sheikh Hamad bin Isa AlKhalifa. 
             Even though Bahrain is a tiny island, their culture is very rich and interesting.</p>

        <h2 class="position2">Religion</h2>
        <div>
             <section><p class="relig"> Bahrain is an Islamic country, which means that the most practiced faith or religion is Islam. 
             The book that they read and follow is called the Quraan. 
             Since it is an islamic country, a call to a prayer is called five times a day from their place of practice, which is a mosque.
             As soon as those prayers are called, men get ready to go pray, while woman pray at home. Nevertheless, other religions could be practiced without receiving any hate or discrimination. 
             Hence, it is a very tolerant country to other religions.
              A simple sign that shows how tolerate Bahrain is with other religions is having other worship places for religions other than Islam. </p></section>
